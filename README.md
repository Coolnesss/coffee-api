# Coffee API

We're tracking the amount of coffee in Gurula, and combined with the [GurulaCoffee app](https://github.com/Coolnesss/gurula-coffee) we can let users track the amount of coffee there is, and send notifications to users when there's fresh coffee available.

This project serves as the json API for the app. We're using machine vision to look at the camera and tell how many cups of coffee there are. Our methods keep changing, but so far we've tried clustering, naive bayes, SVM and lasso regression among other things.

To contribute, just fork the repository and run `rspec` to get started.
